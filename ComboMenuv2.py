'''Iteration 2
Add the following features to your first iteration:

 Ask the user whether they would like a beverage (yes, no).
 If they say yes, ask what size beverage they would like: 
    small $1.00
    medium $1.75
    large $2.25
 Have the program output the userâ€™s beverage size selection, or lack of selection, to verify that the program is working correctly.
 Have the program output the total cost so far.'''
